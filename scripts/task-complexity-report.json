      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Setup Multi-Tenant Architecture",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the multi-tenant architecture implementation into specific subtasks covering subdomain routing, database schema design, middleware creation, tenant identification, query scoping, and package integration.",
      "reasoning": "This is a foundational task with high complexity as it establishes the core architecture. It requires deep Laravel knowledge, database design skills, and understanding of multi-tenancy patterns. It has no dependencies but is a dependency for many other tasks."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement User Authentication & Agent Management",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the authentication system implementation into subtasks covering tenant-aware login, role-based access control, agent management CRUD operations, permission system, and subdomain-based tenant detection.",
      "reasoning": "Authentication with multi-tenancy adds complexity to standard auth flows. The role-based access control and tenant boundary enforcement require careful implementation. This builds on the multi-tenant foundation and requires both backend and frontend work."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Develop IMAP Integration for Email Fetching",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the IMAP integration into subtasks covering mailbox configuration storage, scheduled email fetching, email parsing and metadata extraction, attachment handling, queue implementation, and error handling for connection issues.",
      "reasoning": "IMAP integration involves external system dependencies, asynchronous processing, and complex email parsing. The need to handle various email formats, encodings, and edge cases adds significant complexity. This is a core feature requiring robust implementation."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Create Thread Model & Database Schema",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the data model implementation into subtasks covering database schema design, model relationships, tenant scoping implementation, index optimization, and test data creation.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires careful database design to support the application's core functionality. The relationships between threads, messages, and other entities need proper modeling. Performance considerations and tenant scoping add complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Build Shared Inbox UI with Nuxt.js",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the frontend development into subtasks covering Nuxt.js project setup, thread list component, thread detail view, email content rendering with sanitization, responsive design implementation, and API integration.",
      "reasoning": "Frontend development with Nuxt.js requires significant work across multiple components. Email content rendering with proper sanitization is particularly challenging. The UI needs to be responsive and handle various email formats while maintaining good performance."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Agent Assignment & Collaboration Features",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the collaboration features into subtasks covering thread assignment API endpoints, internal notes functionality, disposition system implementation, UI components for collaboration, and activity logging.",
      "reasoning": "This task builds on existing models but adds business logic for collaboration. It requires both backend API development and frontend components. The activity logging for audit trails adds some complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Outbound Email Reply Functionality",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the email reply functionality into subtasks covering rich text editor integration, outbound email sending implementation, reply threading logic, email signature management, draft saving functionality, and attachment handling.",
      "reasoning": "Outbound email functionality involves rich text editing, proper email formatting, and integration with email sending services. Handling attachments, signatures, and ensuring proper threading adds complexity. Draft saving requires additional state management."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Real-Time Updates with WebSockets",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the real-time functionality into subtasks covering WebSocket server setup, event broadcasting implementation, tenant-aware channel creation, frontend event listeners, and notification system.",
      "reasoning": "Real-time updates with WebSockets add significant complexity, especially in a multi-tenant environment. Setting up Laravel Echo Server with Redis, implementing proper authentication, and ensuring tenant isolation for broadcasts requires careful implementation."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Create Tenant Management & Configuration",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the tenant management into subtasks covering super-admin interface development, tenant-specific settings implementation, mailbox connection testing, tenant provisioning workflow, and audit logging.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating administrative interfaces and workflows for tenant management. While it builds on the existing multi-tenant architecture, it requires careful implementation of tenant provisioning and configuration management."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 10,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Error Handling, Logging & Final Polish",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the final polishing work into subtasks covering comprehensive error handling, logging implementation, UI/UX improvements, and performance optimization.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves adding robustness and polish to the application. While it spans multiple areas, each component is relatively straightforward. The focus is on improving existing functionality rather than building new features."
