# CollaborInbox Task Report

This report outlines the project tasks based on `scripts/task-complexity-report.json` and aligns them with the current exploration documented in `GEMINI_NOTES.md`.

## Project Tasks Overview (from `scripts/task-complexity-report.json`)

The project is structured around 10 main tasks, each with an assigned complexity score (1-10) and recommended subtasks.

### Task 1: Setup Multi-Tenant Architecture (Complexity: 8)
*   **Description:** Establish the core multi-tenant architecture including subdomain routing, database schema design, middleware, tenant identification, query scoping, and package integration.
*   **Exploration Alignment:** Partially explored.
    *   `GEMINI_NOTES.md` sections 2 (Multi-Tenancy Implementation) and 12 (Tenant Management) detail the `BelongsToTenant` trait, `TenantResolver`, and `TenantManager` service, which are foundational to this task.
    *   The `TENANCY-SETUP.md` also provides setup instructions.

### Task 2: Implement User Authentication & Agent Management (Complexity: 7)
*   **Description:** Develop a tenant-aware authentication system, role-based access control, agent management CRUD operations, and a permission system.
*   **Exploration Alignment:** Partially explored.
    *   `GEMINI_NOTES.md` section 1 (Core Data Models) covers the `User`, `Role`, and `Permission` models.
    *   `GEMINI_NOTES.md` sections 10 (API Routes and Authentication Flow), 11 (User-Tenant Enforcement), 13 (Role-Based Access Control), and 14 (Permission-Based Access Control) detail the API routes, `EnsureUserBelongsToTenant`, `RoleMiddleware`, and `PermissionMiddleware`.

### Task 3: Develop IMAP Integration for Email Fetching (Complexity: 8)
*   **Description:** Implement IMAP integration for mailbox configuration storage, scheduled email fetching, parsing, attachment handling, and queue implementation.
*   **Exploration Alignment:** Fully explored.
    *   `GEMINI_NOTES.md` sections 3 (IMAP Integration), 4 (Mailbox Configuration), 5 (Email Fetching), 7 (Email Parsing), and 8 (Attachment Handling) provide a comprehensive analysis of `ImapService`, `MailboxConfiguration`, `FetchEmailsJob`, `EmailParserService`, and `AttachmentService`.

### Task 4: Create Thread Model & Database Schema (Complexity: 7)
*   **Description:** Design the database schema and models for threads, messages, and their relationships, including tenant scoping and index optimization.
*   **Exploration Alignment:** Explored.
    *   `GEMINI_NOTES.md` section 1 (Core Data Models) covers the `Thread` and `Message` models.

### Task 5: Build Shared Inbox UI with Nuxt.js (Complexity: 7)
*   **Description:** Frontend development including Nuxt.js setup, thread list and detail views, email content rendering, responsive design, and API integration.
*   **Exploration Alignment:** Partially explored.
    *   `GEMINI_NOTES.md` section 9.5 (Next Steps for Exploration) notes this as an area for future deep dive.
    *   We've observed the `resources/frontend` directory structure and the `index.js` export hub, indicating a component-based frontend, but the main routing mechanism (e.g., `pages` directory) appears unconventional or empty.

### Task 6: Implement Agent Assignment & Collaboration Features (Complexity: 6)
*   **Description:** Develop API endpoints and UI components for thread assignment, internal notes, and a disposition system.
*   **Exploration Alignment:** Not yet explored in detail.
    *   `GEMINI_NOTES.md` section 1 (Core Data Models) covers the `User` model's `assignedThreads` relationship, which is relevant.

### Task 7: Develop Outbound Email Reply Functionality (Complexity: 7)
*   **Description:** Implement rich text editor integration, outbound email sending, reply threading logic, email signature management, and draft saving.
*   **Exploration Alignment:** Not yet explored.

### Task 8: Implement Real-Time Updates with WebSockets (Complexity: 8)
*   **Description:** Set up WebSocket server, implement event broadcasting, tenant-aware channel creation, and frontend event listeners.
*   **Exploration Alignment:** Partially explored.
    *   `resources/frontend/README.md` provides a good overview of the WebSocket components (`WebSocketService`, `NotificationManager`, `AgentNotificationSystem`).

### Task 9: Create Tenant Management & Configuration (Complexity: 6)
*   **Description:** Develop a super-admin interface for tenant management, tenant-specific settings, mailbox connection testing, and provisioning workflows.
*   **Exploration Alignment:** Partially explored.
    *   `GEMINI_NOTES.md` section 4 (Mailbox Configuration) and 12 (Tenant Management) are relevant to this task.

### Task 10: Implement Error Handling, Logging & Final Polish (Complexity: 5)
*   **Description:** Comprehensive error handling, logging implementation, UI/UX improvements, and performance optimization.
*   **Exploration Alignment:** Partially observed.
    *   Logging is present in various services and jobs (e.g., `ImapService`, `FetchEmailsJob`, `TenantManager`).
